# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This chatbot is designed to help you with your penetration testing. It is based on the [ChainLit](https://docs.chainlit.io/get-started/overview). 
This project is a project work for the course "AI in Cybersecurity" at the University of Deggendorf. It is only a
proof of concept and is not yet a universal tool for penetration testing.
